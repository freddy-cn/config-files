# DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
#      tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.
# 
#      The default command key bindings are:
# 
#    C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-space
bind-key C-space send-prefix
